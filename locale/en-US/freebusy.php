												This is used for example for the in-house "Coodle".<br><br>
												FreeBusy is a function that allows you to see when others are free or busy (without revealing sensitive details such as the appointment titles or content).<br>
												This tool allows you and your colleagues to efficiently schedule meetings.<br><br>
												To effectively use your FreeBusy URL it is necessary to carefully enter and update your calendar data.<br>
												In general, you can enter the times that you are available or busy in a web calendar for both entire calendars as well as individual appointments.<br><br>
												<b>Examples:</b>
												<i>If I enter the vacations of my colleagues, it makes sense to add them to a separate calendar that is not included in MY availability.<br>
												Any notes that I add to my personal calendar should also be marked as "available", unless I am actually busy for that time period.</i><br>';
