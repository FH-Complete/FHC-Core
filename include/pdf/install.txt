The FPDF library is made up of the following elements:

- the main file, fpdf.php, which contains the class
- the font metric files (located in the font directory of this archive)

The metric files are necessary as soon as you want to output text in a document.
They can be accessed from three different locations:

- the current directory (the one where the running script lies)
- one of the directories defined by the include_path parameter
- the directory defined by the FPDF_FONTPATH constant

Here is an example for the last case (note the mandatory final slash):

define('FPDF_FONTPATH','/home/www/font/');
require('fpdf.php');

If the files are not accessible, the SetFont() method will produce the following error:

FPDF error: Could not include font metric file

If so, check if you have correctly defined the constant.

Remarks:

- You can also define FPDF_FONTPATH directly at the beginning of fpdf.php
- Only the files corresponding to the fonts actually used are necessary

The tutorials provided in this package are ready to be executed.
